        <p class="duck-text">Ducks are aquatic birds found in freshwater and coastal habitats around the world. Belonging to the Anatidae family, they are known for their webbed feet, broad bills, and waterproof feathers. Ducks come in many species, with the mallard being one of the most recognizable.

        Most ducks are dabblers or divers, feeding on aquatic plants, insects, and small animals. Dabbling ducks tip forward to forage near the surface, while diving ducks go underwater in search of food. Their waterproof feathers, maintained by oils from a gland near the tail, keep them dry and warm.

        Ducks play important roles in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and spreading plant seeds. They are also significant in many cultures, symbolizing love, fidelity, and peace. While ducks are adaptable, some species face threats from habitat loss and pollution. Conservation efforts are important to protect wetland environments and ensure healthy duck populations for the future.</p>
